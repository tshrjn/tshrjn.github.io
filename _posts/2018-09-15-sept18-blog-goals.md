## Hello World!

I'm starting to take baby steps towards writing blog posts about things I study and do.
So, for the first month, let's try to keep things simple and try to build intuition via milestone papers and concepts for the soaring field of deep reinforcment learning.

This blog is going to be a living doc, where I learn with you guys. Moreover, I'm as new to this field as an infant is to walking. So, please forgive me if I make mistakes and help me correct them. Now let's get ready to dive deep into the field of reinforcement learning.


### Schedule

For this month of September, the following is the aim:
- What is RL? 
- Why RL?
- DQN
- PER
- Buidling Towards Rainbow
- DDPG
- HER
- Curiosity
- Zero-shot Visual Learning
- World models


### Feedback

Please feel free to provide feedback and help in the learning process.
