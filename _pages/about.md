Iâ€™m a grad student at New York University and a member of CILVR Group. My research interest lies in deep reinforcment learning and generative modelling.

Prior to NYU, I completed my bachelors at IIT, Mandi during which I also spent an year at Technical University, Munich (TUM).

## Publications
- **Individualized Controlled Continuous Communication**  
Amanpreet Singh<sup>*</sup>, Tushar Jain<sup>*</sup>, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar  
_Currently in Proceedings of ICLR 2019_  
[[Paper][ic3net_arxiv]] [[Code][ic3net_github]]
 <!-- [Blog (Coming Soon)] -->


## Projects
- **Question Generation**  
_Rajat Agarwal<sup>*</sup>, Tushar Jain<sup>*</sup>, Kumar mehta_  
Survey research project on question generation via machine comprehension and achieved SOTA results for the task using attention with seq-to-seq with beam search.  
[[Report][qgen]]
<!-- [Code] [Blog] -->


- **Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning**  
_Under Prof. Rob Fergus_  
Research on imitation learning using generative model. Designed a novel method for using GANs as environment simulator for model-based Reinforcement Learning.  
<!--[Report] [Code] [Blog] -->


- **Genomics Trait & Disease Prediction**  
_Under Prof. Lawrence Sirovich_  
Research on genomics data (GWAS), where #input-features $$ \gg $$ #training-examples, making it difficult to avoid overfitting, for disease prediction on SNPs.  
<!--[Paper] [Code] [Blog] -->


- **Biometric Data Synthesis Using GAN**  
_Under Prof. Aditya Nigam_  
Research on using multiple generators and discriminators to speed-up GAN training.
Multiple discriminators with varying architecture provided empirical speedup during training time.
